# Changelog

## Version 2.1.3

### 🔧 Bug fixes

- `.yaml` (and every other non-whitelisted file extension) Maven artifacts returned 502/404 from group repositories. `ArtifactNameParser.parseMaven` gated on a hardcoded extension whitelist (`jar|pom|xml|war|aar|ear|module|sha1|sha256|sha512|md5|asc|sig`); `.yaml`, `.json`, `.zip`, `.properties`, `.tgz`, and any future type produced a mangled artifact name that missed the index, causing full proxy fanout that couldn't find the locally-uploaded artifact. Replaced with structural detection: Maven URLs always follow `{groupId}/{artifactId}/{version}/{artifactId}-{version}[-classifier].ext`, so if the final segment starts with `{artifactId}-` it's a filename. Validated against 451,673 production artifacts including non-digit versions (Spring release trains `Arabba-SR10`, git SHAs, word versions) and Scala cross-version artifactIds (`chill_2.12`).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Nested group leaf repos (e.g. `groovy-plugins-release` inside `remote-repos` inside `libs-release`) were unreachable via index hit when Pantera had no explicit repo config for the leaf. `buildLeafMap`/`collectLeaves` silently dropped unconfigured leaves, so the `leafToMember` lookup produced an unmappable name, `targeted` came back empty, and the request fell to proxy-only fanout — skipping hosted members that actually had the artifact. Replaced the static map with `GroupMemberFlattener` which enumerates leaves at construction time and lets `locateByName()` return repo names that match the flattened member list directly. No runtime nested-group recursion, no mapping table to drift.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Circuit breaker at the group level manufactured false 5xx responses. When the index returned `groovy-plugins-release` for an artifact but that member's circuit was OPEN, the resolver skipped the member — even though the bytes were local — and returned 503 to the client. 7,733 such circuit-open/503 entries were observed in 30 minutes of production logs. Circuit breaker now only runs on the fanout path (protects upstreams from thundering herd); the targeted local read path always queries the member the index points to.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `DbArtifactIndex.locateByName` returned `List.of()` for both "row not found" and "DB error", so a transient database outage made every group request fall to proxy-only fanout and return 404 for artifacts that exist in hosted members. Return type changed to `CompletableFuture<Optional<List<String>>>` — `Optional.empty()` on `SQLException` triggers full two-phase fanout as a safety net, `Optional.of(List.of())` is the confirmed-miss case that still goes proxy-only.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `locateByName` SQL had no statement timeout. Under DB pressure or missing-index pathology the query could hang indefinitely, starving the index connection pool at 250+ req/s. Added `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '500ms'` (configurable via `PANTERA_INDEX_LOCATE_TIMEOUT_MS`) using the same transaction-guard pattern as `searchWithLike`. Timeout surfaces as `SQLException` which already maps to `Optional.empty()` → full fanout safety net.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- 3,345 "Internal server error" log entries per 30 minutes had zero stack traces, no `user.name`, no `client.ip`, no `trace.id` — admins saw a generic error message with no way to diagnose or attribute it. All error-path logging in `GroupSlice` now uses `EcsLogger.error(...).error(throwable)` to capture `error.type`/`error.message`/`error.stack_trace`, and MDC fields (user/IP/trace) propagate across async `thenCompose`/`whenComplete` callbacks via new `MdcPropagation` wrappers (CompletableFuture callbacks previously ran on pool threads with empty MDC).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Internal group-to-member fanout queries emitted 105,796 access log entries per 30 minutes — 26% of all log volume, indistinguishable from real client requests but with no `user.name`/`client.ip`/`trace.id`. `GroupSlice` now adds an `X-Pantera-Internal: true` marker header when dispatching to members; `EcsLoggingSlice` checks the header and skips access log emission (internal routing is still captured as DEBUG application logs in `GroupSlice`). The marker does not leak to upstream — all proxy slices pass `Headers.EMPTY` to the upstream HTTP client.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `event.duration` had inconsistent units — some code paths wrote nanoseconds, others wrote microseconds, others milliseconds. Both `EcsLogger.duration(long ms)` and `EcsLogEvent.duration(long ms)` removed their `* 1_000_000` conversion; every log entry now emits `event.duration` in milliseconds (Pantera convention). See logging admin guide §event.duration for the Kibana query migration (`> 5000000000` → `> 5000`).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `event.category` values used throughout the codebase (`repository`, `group`, `cache`, `cooldown`, `pypi`, `storage`, `scheduling`, etc.) were not in the ECS allowed-values list, causing dashboards filtering on ECS categories to return empty. 488 call sites across 121 files migrated: repository/http/server/docker/group/pypi/npm/maven → `web`, cache/cooldown/search/index → `database`, storage → `file`, scheduling/metrics → `process`, cluster/system → `host`, user/admin → `iam`, security → `authentication`, webhook → `network`, factory → `configuration`. See the migration table in the logging admin guide.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `DRAIN_EXECUTOR` queue overflow (4 threads, 200-entry bounded queue) logged dropped tasks at DEBUG level — silent in production where DEBUG is disabled. Each dropped drain is a potential member-response body leak. Now logged at WARN with a `DRAIN_DROP_COUNT` atomic counter exposed via `drainDropCount()` for metrics integration.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🌟 New features

- **Stale-while-revalidate for proxy artifact binaries.** Enabled by default. When a proxy member's upstream fails (timeout, 5xx, connection refused) and the cached bytes are within `staleMaxAge` (default 1 hour), the proxy serves the cached artifact with `200 OK` + `X-Pantera-Stale: true` + `Age: <seconds>` (RFC 7234) headers. Age is tracked via a new `savedAt` timestamp in the metadata sidecar JSON — backwards-compatible with pre-2.1.3 sidecars (missing `savedAt` is treated as fresh on first read). Operators disable per-repo via `cache.stale_while_revalidate.enabled: false` in YAML.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- **Negative cache for group proxy fanout.** Prevents thundering-herd: when all proxy members return 404 for a missing artifact, the `(group, artifactName)` pair is cached for a short TTL (default 5 minutes) so subsequent requests return 404 instantly without a second fanout. Two-tier L1 Caffeine + L2 Valkey via the existing `NegativeCacheConfig` pattern; configurable per-deployment under `meta.caches.group-negative` in `pantera.yml`. Falls back to in-memory L1 only (matching historical behaviour) when the config section is absent.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- **Concurrent request coalescing.** When N requests arrive simultaneously for the same missing artifact, only one fanout runs — the N-1 followers wait on an `inFlightFanouts` gate and, on leader completion, re-enter `proxyOnlyFanout` to hit the freshly-populated negative cache (instant 404) or the cached proxy response. Combined with the negative cache, fully eliminates the thundering herd for missing artifacts.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- **`staleMaxAge` enforcement.** `BaseCachedProxySlice.tryServeStale` now computes `age = now - savedAt` from the metadata sidecar and refuses to serve stale bytes older than `ProxyCacheConfig.staleMaxAge()`. Previously the feature was partial — age was not checked, so arbitrarily old cached bytes could be served when upstream was down. Legacy sidecar files without `savedAt` get `Instant.now()` as a fallback (treated as fresh on first read), enabling rolling upgrades without data migration.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- **Token expiry dropdown in the avatar menu popup.** The "Generate API Token" dialog in `AppHeader.vue` previously used a numeric input field (0-365 days, 0 = permanent). Replaced with a `<Select>` dropdown matching `ProfileView.vue`'s pattern: 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 days / Permanent. Respects admin settings: `api_token_max_ttl_seconds` gates the numeric options, `api_token_allow_permanent` gates the Permanent option.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🏗️ Architectural changes

- **Group resolution redesigned around a 5-path decision tree.** Previous code had tight coupling between parser accuracy, the `leafToMember` map, and the circuit breaker — any single failure produced false 5xx. New flow:
  1. **Unparseable URL** (metadata endpoints, root paths) → full two-phase fanout (hosted first, then proxy cascade).
  2. **Index DB error** → full two-phase fanout (safety net; we don't know what's in the index).
  3. **Index confirmed miss** → proxy-only fanout (hosted repos are fully indexed, so absence from index = absence from hosted). Checks negative cache first.
  4. **Index hit** → targeted local read against the member(s) the index returned. No circuit breaker (the bytes are local; skipping a known-good location creates false 5xx). No fallback fanout on 5xx (no other member has the bytes).
  5. **Index-hit orphan** (index returned a repo name not in the flattened member list) → full fanout as safety net.

  HTTP status codes: `500` for local read failure (targeted path), `502` for upstream gateway failure (fanout path), `404` for confirmed not-found. **No `503` from group resolution.** Circuit-breaker state is logged as structured application logs, never returned as HTTP status.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- **Token generation UI consolidated.** Removed the generation form from the Profile page — token creation is now exclusively available via the avatar-menu popup. The Profile page retains the Active Tokens list (view / revoke existing tokens).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Deleted `leafToMember` map and its `buildLeafMap`/`collectLeaves` helpers in `RepositorySlices` — replaced by construction-time `GroupMemberFlattener.flatten()` which enumerates leaves once with cycle detection.
- Deleted `MAVEN_FILE_EXT` regex whitelist in `ArtifactNameParser` — replaced by structural filename-prefix detection.
- Deleted `RequestContext.addTo()` — a pass-through no-op retained after an earlier MDC cleanup. All 10 call sites simplified from `ctx.addTo(EcsLogger.warn(...)).log()` to direct `EcsLogger.warn(...).log()`. `RequestContext` trimmed from 4 fields to 1 (`packageName`).
- Deleted the legacy `queryAllMembersInParallel` and `queryMember` helpers — dead after the 5-path rewrite.
- Renamed `pantera-core/.../com.auto1.pantera.http.group.GroupSlice` to `RaceSlice` to resolve the naming clash with `pantera-main/.../com.auto1.pantera.group.GroupSlice`. The two classes served different purposes (low-level first-response-wins utility vs. hot-path group resolver); the rename makes intent explicit. 9 files updated (6 proxy adapters + 1 IT case + the class + its test).

### 📚 Documentation

- Logging admin guide (`docs/admin-guide/logging.md`) updated with the new ECS-compliant `event.category` value set, a migration table mapping old Pantera categories to ECS allowed values, and a note that `event.duration` is now in milliseconds (with a Kibana query conversion example — `> 1000000000` for 1s becomes `> 1000`).
- Group resolution redesign spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-group-resolution-redesign.md`) documents the 5-path flow, the circuit breaker strategy, the negative cache configuration, the stale-while-revalidate design, the ECS category migration, and the deferred items (non-Maven metadata caching, cross-type repo verification).

### ✅ Testing

- `ArtifactNameParserMavenStructuralTest` (47 parameterised tests) covers `.yaml`, `.json`, `.zip`, Spring release trains, git SHAs, Scala cross-version artifactIds, classifiers, checksums, metadata endpoints, and short paths.
- `GroupSliceFlattenedResolutionTest` covers all 5 resolution paths plus the critical "index hit + member 5xx → 500 (no fanout)" invariant, concurrent-miss coalescing, and the X-Pantera-Internal marker propagation.
- `BaseCachedProxySliceStaleTest` covers stale-serve on upstream timeout/5xx, stale refusal beyond `staleMaxAge`, absent-metadata existence fallback, and SWR-disabled propagation.
- `NegativeCacheConfigTest` covers the new `fromYaml(caches, subKey)` overload for per-group config sections.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- `event.duration` is now emitted in **milliseconds**, not nanoseconds. Kibana saved queries comparing to nanosecond thresholds (e.g. `event.duration > 5000000000` for 5s) must be updated to the ms equivalent (`> 5000`). See logging admin guide for the migration table.
- `event.category` values migrated to the ECS allowed-values set. Dashboards and alerts filtering on old Pantera-specific categories (`repository`, `group`, `cache`, `cooldown`, `pypi`, etc.) must be updated. Mapping table in logging admin guide.
- `ArtifactIndex.locateByName` signature changed from `CompletableFuture<List<String>>` to `CompletableFuture<Optional<List<String>>>`. External implementers of `ArtifactIndex` must adopt the new return type (`Optional.of(repos)` on success, `Optional.empty()` on DB error).
- No `503` responses from group resolution. Clients that retried on `503` will now see `404` (miss), `500` (local error), or `502` (gateway error). Maven/Gradle build tooling is unaffected — they already retry on 5xx.

## Version 2.1.2

### 🔒 Security

- `jwt-password` and `local` auth providers were silently disabled on every request on deployments that never had their rows in the `auth_providers` table. The v2.1.0 changelog promised they are "mandatory and cannot be removed" but no Flyway migration seeded them — so `DbGatedAuth` saw the row absent, returned `false` from `isEnabled()`, and every UI-generated API token used in Basic auth failed verification *before* reaching the RS256 validator. Symptom: `/pypi` and every other main-port repo request returned 401 with a single `Failed to authenticate user` WARN showing `CachedUsers(size=0)` — no indication that `jwt-password` even existed. Fixed with V118 `seed_mandatory_auth_providers.sql` using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so existing deployments auto-heal on restart without clobbering operator choices.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Conan adapter's `ItemTokenizer` signed and verified per-item tokens with a hardcoded HMAC secret (`"some secret"`, committed to source since the Artipie fork). Anyone with repo access could forge Conan upload/download URL tokens. Migrated to RS256 using the same cluster-wide key pair as the main auth flow — keys are threaded through `RepositorySlices` from the `JwtTokens` instance, so HA nodes that share the pair continue to verify each other's tokens without any additional config.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `jwt-password` auth provider silently validated tokens against a hardcoded fallback HMAC secret. The v2.1.0 switch to RS256 asymmetric signing removed `meta.jwt.secret`, but `JwtPasswordAuthFactory` kept the old HS256 code path — when `secret` came back `null` it fell back to the literal string `"jwt-password-fallback-secret"` and only emitted a WARN. UI-generated API tokens (signed with the real RSA private key) never verified against that fallback, so every Basic-auth attempt using a UI-generated token failed, and the provider's security model was effectively a shared, publicly-known HMAC key. Factory now loads `meta.jwt.public-key-path` and builds an RS256 `JWTAuth` — same key pair as `JwtTokens`, so API tokens the user generates via the UI authenticate correctly. Missing `public-key-path` now fails fast at startup with an actionable error instead of deferring to a broken fallback.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Profile → **Active Tokens** UI leaked the user's refresh-token JTI. Every login / SSO callback / refresh cycle wrote a row to `user_tokens` with `token_type = 'refresh'` and `label = "Refresh Token"`, but `UserTokenDao.listByUser` had no `token_type` filter — so the list returned every type and the UI rendered a revocable "Refresh Token" entry alongside the user's real API tokens. A user could click the trash icon and kill their own session; worse, anyone with access to the DB-facing audit trail could infer refresh JTIs from the response. Filter is now `token_type = 'api'`. The self-service `DELETE /api/v1/auth/tokens/:id` endpoint is hardened with the same scope so the UUID cannot be used to revoke a refresh token even if guessed — refresh revocation remains available via logout and the admin revoke-user path.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🔧 Bug fixes

- `JwtPasswordAuthFactory` double-nested `cfg.yamlMapping("meta")` but `initAuth()` already passes the `meta` mapping as `cfg`. The factory looked for `meta.meta.jwt` — which doesn't exist — got `null`, and threw `"public-key-path is not configured"` at startup. The catch in `initAuth` swallowed it as a WARN, so `jwt-password` was silently never added to the auth chain and every API-token-as-password request returned 401. Fix: `JwtSettings.fromYaml(cfg)` (no extra nesting).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Version-repair CLI (`--mode version-repair`) crashed on `artifacts_repo_name_name_version_key` unique constraint when the same artifact name had both a `version='UNKNOWN'` row and an already-correct versioned row. The batch UPDATE now includes a `NOT EXISTS` guard that skips conflicting rows instead of aborting the entire batch.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `JwtPasswordAuth` catch-all swallowed every JWT verification failure (wrong signature, expired, key mismatch) with no log. Added DEBUG-level logging with the exception message so operators can diagnose failures via `-Dlog4j.logger.com.auto1.pantera.auth=DEBUG`.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- API listener fails ALB health checks when `meta.http_server.proxy_protocol: "true"` is enabled. ALB does not emit PROXYv2 (it terminates L7 and adds `X-Forwarded-For` instead), so plain `GET /` health-probe bytes were being misparsed by Pantera's PROXY decoder and the connection closed with `HAProxyProtocolException`. The target group then marked the API port unhealthy with no useful Pantera log entry. Fixed by introducing a per-listener PROXYv2 toggle for the API port — see `meta.http_server.api_proxy_protocol` below.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🌟 New features

- New `meta.http_server.api_proxy_protocol` flag controls PROXYv2 on the API listener (typically port 8086) independently from the main + per-repo listeners. Defaults to the value of `meta.http_server.proxy_protocol` for backward compatibility — pre-2.1.2 deployments that set a single `proxy_protocol: true` keep their existing behaviour. Operators with a mixed topology (NLB → main port + ALB → API port) set `api_proxy_protocol: "false"` to keep PROXYv2 on for the NLB-fronted listeners while disabling it on the ALB-fronted API port.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed `JwtPasswordAuth.fromSecret(Vertx, String)` — the pre-2.1.0 HS256 entry point. Production no longer calls it (the factory now builds an RS256 `JWTAuth` directly), and the pre-2.1.2 test that exercised it was masking the broken-factory regression. `JwtPasswordAuthTest` rewritten against the committed RSA key-pair fixtures so a future sign/verify mismatch cannot hide.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Removed the HS256 `JWTAuthHandler` fallback in `AsyncApiVerticle` (`unifiedAuth == null` branch). Dead in production since 2.1.0, but a latent trap — a misconfigured deploy without RS256 keys now fails fast with an actionable error instead of silently routing every request through an unconfigured HMAC validator.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Swept docs/operator configs still referencing the removed `meta.jwt.secret` / `JWT_SECRET`: `README.md`, `docs/ha-deployment/pantera-ha.yml`, `docs/ha-deployment/docker-compose-ha.yml`, `docs/admin-guide/installation.md`, `docs/admin-guide/upgrade-procedures.md`, `docs/admin-guide/troubleshooting.md`. All now show `private-key-path` / `public-key-path` (and the matching `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` env vars). A fresh 2.1.2 deploy following any of these docs no longer fails at startup.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Stale Javadoc on `JwtPasswordAuth` and `JwtPasswordAuthFactory` updated from HS256 / `meta.jwt.secret` wording to the RS256 key-path configuration.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 📚 Documentation

- Configuration reference §1.8 expanded with the new `api_proxy_protocol` key and a topology note explaining why ALB and PROXYv2 are mutually exclusive.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Admin-guide configuration page gained a "Mixed NLB + ALB topology" section walking operators through the symptom (ALB target group reports unhealthy with no Pantera log) and the fix.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

## Version 2.1.1

### 🔧 Bug fixes

- Startup fails with `algid parse error, not a sequence` when the JWT private key is PEM-encoded as PKCS#1 (`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`). `RsaKeyLoader` now detects the format from the PEM header and wraps PKCS#1 in a PKCS#8 envelope in-memory; PKCS#8 keys continue to load unchanged. Supports 2048- and 4096-bit RSA. The misleading `openssl genrsa` hint in the missing-key error message has been replaced with the PKCS#8-producing `openssl genpkey` form.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `proxy_protocol: true` silently downgraded to plain HTTP because `netty-codec-haproxy` was not on the classpath. Vert.x logged `Proxy protocol support could not be enabled` at startup and then served NLB-wrapped traffic as malformed HTTP, breaking every connection behind a PROXY-v2 load balancer. Added `io.netty:netty-codec-haproxy` to `pantera-main` (version aligned with the `vertx-dependencies` BOM, currently 4.1.132.Final).
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Elastic ingest pipeline rejects logs with `Duplicate field 'service.version'`. The `EcsLayout` serializer already emits `service.version`, `process.thread.name`, and the other service metadata fields; three call sites were adding them again via `.field()` and producing duplicate JSON keys. Removed the redundant emits at startup log, scheduler queue log, and blocked-thread diagnostics; the blocked-thread diagnostic now reports the target thread name in the message and under `pantera.blocked_thread.name`.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### 📚 Documentation

- Configuration reference now covers scheduled scripts (`meta.crontab`), experimental HTTP/3 support, and repository filter blocks — previously only documented under the admin guide.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Admin-guide configuration page collapsed to a slim overview that defers to the reference for full key lists, eliminating duplicated YAML samples.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- Design/planning documents removed from `docs/plans/`.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))

### ✅ Testing

- `RsaKeyLoaderTest` rewritten with committed PKCS#1/PKCS#8 fixture pairs at 2048 and 4096 bits; asserts both formats yield identical key material and that the DER long-form length path is exercised for 4096-bit keys.
  ([@aydasraf](https://github.com/aydasraf))
- `ProxyProtocolV2Test` added: stands up a Vert.x HTTP server with `setUseProxyProtocol(true)`, writes a Netty-encoded PROXYv2 header over a raw socket (TCP4 + TCP6), and asserts the handler sees the client IP from the header rather than the loopback address. Double-guards the classpath — if `netty-codec-haproxy` is ever dropped, the test class itself won't load.
